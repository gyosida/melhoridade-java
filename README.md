:# Melhoridade REST API
 
Melhoridade is a college project from the Projeto Integrado II course. It exposes a group of resources through a Java REST API. The idea behind it is to provide an easy to use web app for elderly people that look for activities offered by colaborators (establishments) according to their needs and preferences.
 
### Installation
 
To get Melhoridade up and running, you need to install:
* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and MySQL Workbench preferably
* For better Spring compatibility the IDE [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools)
 
When installing the JDK, you should set the JAVA_HOME. For better understanding check this: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19182-01/820-7851/inst_cli_jdk_javahome_t/
 
### Libraries
 
Melhoridade REST API uses the following libraries:
 
* Spring Boot and its subprojects like MVC, Security, Data, Mysql Connector
* Json Web Token (JWT)
 
### Heads Up
To get the app running you would need a couple of config files which are the application.properties and a little sql script with basic data to be loaded when starting up. Just ask for them.
